## Installation & Deployment ðŸ“¦
- Clone the repository and modify the content of <b>index.html</b> according to your requirement.
- Add or remove images from `varadbhogayata.github.io/assets/img/` directory as per your requirement.
- I highly recommend to use [Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to deploy the website the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, first you need to create github repository with name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give any other name.
- Push the generated code to the `master` branch of this repository.
- <b>NOTE:</b> Make sure to set `analyticsId` from your Google Analytics account inside the Google Analytics script tag, if you want to use your own Google Analytics account.
